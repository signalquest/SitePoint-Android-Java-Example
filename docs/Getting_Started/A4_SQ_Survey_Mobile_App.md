# SQ Survey Mobile App

SQ Survey is a comprehensive mobile application developed by SignalQuest for surveying and related use cases. While its source code is proprietary, the app exemplifies the capabilities achievable with the SitePoint SDK.

## Extended Features

SQ Survey incorporates additional functionalities beyond the core SitePoint SDK, including:

- Map-based SitePoint location display
- Project-based point collection and storage
- NTRIP caster querying and mountpoint listing
- Multiple NTRIP server configuration management
- RTCM message and error logging for NTRIP
- NTRIP reconnection handling

These features serve as reference points for developers looking to expand upon the concepts demonstrated in the example app.
